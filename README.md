The project simplify identifies the face by drawing a frame around the circle on the video captured by live web camera. MTCNN(Multi Task Convolution Networks) algorithm
is used to capture video.

# Face Detection with MTCNN

This project uses the **MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)** algorithm to detect faces in real-time by capturing video from a live webcam. The detected faces are highlighted with a bounding box around them, simplifying face identification.

## Features:
- Real-time face detection using the webcam.
- The MTCNN algorithm is employed for efficient and accurate face detection.
- Live video frame capture with bounding boxes drawn around detected faces.

## Prerequisites:
Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MTCNN

## To Run the Project Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
